# Bots

Bots are accounts on the network that post automatically. Popular ones include bots that post the magnitude of recent earthquakes, photos from an archive on a regular schedule, etc.

You can skip the below tutorial and find the full starter script [here](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/ts-bot).

## Starter Template

Here's a TypeScript script that creates a bot that posts a smiley emoji on an automated schedule once every three hours. This guide assumes you already have typescript installed, and some familiarity with your terminal.

### Getting Started

Install TypeScript, Node and the ATProto API
```
npm i -g typescript
npm i -g ts-node
npm i @atproto/api
```

### Create your Script

Let's write the actual code which will run our bot. We will create a bot which posts ðŸ™‚ every three hours. 

Our example will require some packages. Install dotenv, cron, and process, and initialise Typescript
```
npm i dotenv
npm i cron
npm i process
npm install --save-dev @types/node
npx tsc --init
```

Next, save your bot's username and password to a `.env` file. This file should not be shared publicly.
```
BLUESKY_USERNAME=exampleUsername@bsky.social
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=examplePassword123
```

Now we can start writing our bot! Create a file called main.ts, and write the following code:
```TypeScript
// Import our packages
import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { CronJob } from 'cron';
import * as process from 'process';

dotenv.config();

// Create a ATProto Agent using a given PDS.
// For most people, just use https://bsky.social
const agent = new AtpAgent({
    service: 'https://bsky.social',
})

// Our main code -- this will be run every three hours
async function main() {
    await agent.login({ identifier: process.env.BLUESKY_USERNAME!, password: process.env.BLUESKY_PASSWORD!})
    await agent.post({
        text: "ðŸ™‚"
    });
    console.log("Just posted!")
}

// Run main() once, on startup
main();


// Create a 'cronjob' which will automatically run main() again, once every three hours
const scheduleExpressionMinute = '* * * * *'; // Run once every minute for testing
const scheduleExpression = '0 */3 * * *'; // Run once every three hours in prod

const job = new CronJob(scheduleExpression, main); // change to scheduleExpressionMinute for testing

job.start();
```

Now, let's build and run our bot. Open a console in the bot's directory, and type:
```
npx tsc
node index.js
```

Congratulations! You've now built you first Bluesky bot. Check its' account to view the post(s).

### Deploying Your Bot

You can deploy a simple bot for no or low cost on a variety of platforms, such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](http://fly.io/).

## Rate Limits & Respecting Other Users

Keep in mind that bots should respect the network's [rate limits](/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits). Automated bots that post to an account on an regular interval are welcome. If your bot interacts with other users, please only interact (like, repost, reply, etc.) if the user has tagged the bot account. It must be an opt-in interaction, or else your bot may be taken for spam.
