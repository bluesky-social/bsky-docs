# Bots

Bots are accounts on the network that post automatically. Popular ones include bots that post the magnitude of recent earthquakes, photos from an archive on a regular schedule, etc.

You can skip the below tutorial and find the full starter script [here](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/ts-bot).

## Starter Template

Here's a TypeScript script that creates a bot that posts a smiley emoji on an automated schedule once every three hours.

### Getting Started

Install TypeScript and Node.
```
npm i -g typescript ts-node
```

Then, save your bot's username and password to a `.env` file.
```
BLUESKY_USERNAME="username.bsky.social"
BLUESKY_PASSWORD="password1234"
```

### Create a Script

The below script will post "Hello, world! ðŸ¦‹" every time it runs.

```TypeScript
import { AtpAgent } from "@atproto/api";
import "node:process";

// Create an AT Protocol Agent
const agent = new AtpAgent({
  service: "https://bsky.social",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    // We just need to log in...
    await agent.login({
      identifier: process.env.BLUESKY_HANDLE!,
      password: process.env.BLUESKY_PASSWORD!,
    });
    console.log("Successfully logged in!");

    // Now we can make our post!
    await agent.post({
      text: "Hello, world! ðŸ¦‹",
    });
    console.log("Successfully posted!");
    // Et voilÃ !
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error("Uh oh! %s", err.message);
  }
}

main();
```

You can run it with:

```console
$ npx tsc
$ node --env-file='.env' main.js
Successfully logged in!
Successfully posted!
```

## Deploying Your Bot

You can deploy a simple bot on your own computer. If you want something more, deploying projects like this can be low cost or even free on a variety of platforms. For example, check out:

- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/reference/fly-launch/)

## Rate Limits & Respecting Other Users

Keep in mind that bots should respect the network's [rate limits](/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits). Automated bots that post to an account on an regular interval are welcome. If your bot interacts with other users, please only interact (like, repost, reply, etc.) if the user has tagged the bot account. It must be an opt-in interaction, or else your bot may be taken for spam.
