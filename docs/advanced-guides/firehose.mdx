# Firehose

One of the core primitives of the AT Protocol that underlies Bluesky is the
*firehose*. It is a partially authenticated stream of events used to efficiently sync
user updates (posts, likes, follows, handle changes, etc).

Many applications people will want to build on top of atproto and Bluesky will
start with the firehose, from feed generators to labelers, to bots and search
engines.

In the atproto ecosystem, there are many different endpoints that serve
firehose APIs. Each PDS serves a stream of all of the activity on the repos it is
responsible for. From there, *relays* aggregate the streams of any PDS who requests it into a single unified stream.

This makes the job of downstream consumers much easier, as you can get all the data from a single
location. The main relay for Bluesky is `bsky.network`, which we use in the examples below.

To get started, you will open a WebSocket connection to your favorite firehose
provider for the `com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos` endpoint:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    ```go
    uri := "wss://bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos"
    con, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial(uri, http.Header{})
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


From there, you need to read off each message as it comes in, and decode the
CBOR event data. More details on this can be found here (TODO: link to lexicon
page).

Most SDKs have a nice wrapper for this though, In this example we will just
print each repo operation in each event we receive. These operations are things
like "create post", "create like", "delete follow" and so on.

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    ```go
    rsc := &events.RepoStreamCallbacks{
      RepoCommit: func(evt *atproto.SyncSubscribeRepos_Commit) error {
        fmt.Println("Event from ", evt.Repo)
        for _, op := range evt.Ops {
          fmt.Printf(" - %s record %s\n", op.Action, op.Path)
        }
        return nil
      },
    }

    sched := sequential.NewScheduler("myfirehose", rsc.EventHandler)
    events.HandleRepoStream(context.Background(), con, sched)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



In this snippet we set up a sequential "scheduler", which handles all events
sequentially in order. Other schedulers run event handling in parallel, or do
limited concurrency based on who the event is for.

Once we have a scheduler, we call into `HandleRepoStream` which does the actual
decoding of the data coming over the websocket and calls into the event handler
we wrote.

## Authentication

The firehose provides partial authentication of its stream of events, this means
that there are certain events which cannot be trusted without additional
verification.

All events are authenticated to ensure that no one can pretend to create events
on other actor's user repos. But this doesn't stop actors from creating records
on their user repos that purport to be a part of another user's repo.

One way this can be achieved is by creating a
[listitem record](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/app/bsky/graph/listitem.json)
with a `list` field which points at another user's list. In that case the actor
who created the listitem will not match the owner of the list. An example of
such a record is available at
[here](https://pdsls.dev/at/did:plc:oisofpd7lj26yvgiivf3lxsi/app.bsky.graph.listitem/3lfpwv6z7zc26).
The firehose will send such records out to subscribers, so it is important to verify
the ownership of a list when ingesting these events.
