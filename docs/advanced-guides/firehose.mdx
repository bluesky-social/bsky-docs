# Firehose

One of the core primitives of the AT Protocol that underlies Bluesky is the
*firehose*. It is an authenticated stream of events used to efficiently sync
user updates (posts, likes, follows, handle changes, etc).

Many applications people will want to build on top of atproto and Bluesky will
start with the firehose, from feed generators to labelers, to bots and search
engines.

In the atproto ecosystem, there are many different endpoints that serve
firehose APIs. Each PDS serves a stream of all of the activity on the repos it is
responsible for. From there, *relays* aggregate the streams of any PDS who requests it into a single unified stream.

This makes the job of downstream consumers much easier, as you can get all the data from a single
location. The main relay for Bluesky is `bsky.network`, which we use in the examples below.

To get started, you will open a WebSocket connection to your favorite firehose
provider for the `com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos` endpoint:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    ```go
    uri := "wss://relay1.us-east.bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos"
    con, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial(uri, http.Header{})
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
We previously provided a `wss://bsky.network` example URL here. This endpoint does not provide `prevData` which may limit your use of the firehose in some contexts. When in doubt, use the [Sync 1.1 endpoints](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/relay-sync-updates#staged-rollout).
:::

From there, you need to read off each message as it comes in, and decode the
CBOR event data. More details on this can be found [here](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon)

Most SDKs have a nice wrapper for this though, In this example we will just
print each repo operation in each event we receive. These operations are things
like "create post", "create like", "delete follow" and so on.

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    ```go
    rsc := &events.RepoStreamCallbacks{
      RepoCommit: func(evt *atproto.SyncSubscribeRepos_Commit) error {
        fmt.Println("Event from ", evt.Repo)
        for _, op := range evt.Ops {
          fmt.Printf(" - %s record %s\n", op.Action, op.Path)
        }
        return nil
      },
    }

    sched := sequential.NewScheduler("myfirehose", rsc.EventHandler)
    events.HandleRepoStream(context.Background(), con, sched)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



In this snippet we set up a sequential "scheduler", which handles all events
sequentially in order. Other schedulers run event handling in parallel, or do
limited concurrency based on who the event is for.

Once we have a scheduler, we call into `HandleRepoStream` which does the actual
decoding of the data coming over the websocket and calls into the event handler
we wrote.

If you want a more simplified firehose where events are JSON, you can connect
to the [JetStream](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/jetstream) websocket:
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    import asyncio
    import websockets

    uri = "wss://jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe?wantedCollections=app.bsky.feed.post"

    async def listen_to_websocket():
      async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        while True:
          try:
            message = await websocket.recv()
            print(message)
          except websockets.ConnectionClosed as e:
            print(f"Connection closed: {e}")
            break
          except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
    
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(listen_to_websocket())
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
