# Service Auth

There are currently two "types" of auth supported in the atproto network: client-server auth and service-to-service auth.

The PDS is the root of a user's authority. Service auth is used when making a request from the PDS to another service on behalf of the user.

These service auth tokens take the form of a simple asymmetrically signed JWT.

The payload of the JWT looks like:

```TypeScript
type Payload = {
  iss: // user's DID
  aud: // DID of the service that the request is being made to
  exp: // expiration date of the token, normally set to a short timeframe (<60s)
}
```

This JWT is signed by the signing key included in the user's DID document (the same signing key that signs repository updates).

For more details on these service auth tokens, check out the [atproto specs](https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc#inter-service-authentication-temporary-specification).

## Usage

To create and verify service auth tokens, you can use the `@atproto/xrpc-server` library.

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
    ```ts
    import { createServiceJwt, verifyServiceJwt } from '@atproto/xrpc-server'
    import { IdResolver } from '@atproto/identity'

    // Creating a service JWT
    const keypair = // users keypair

    const jwt = await createServiceJwt({
      iss: // usersDid
      aud: 'did:example:server',
      keypair,
    })


    // Verifying a service JWT
    // helper method to resolve a user's DID to their atproto signing key
    const idResolver = new IdResolver()
    const getSigningKey = async (
      did: string,
      forceRefresh: boolean,
    ): Promise<string> => {
      return this.idResolver.did.resolveAtprotoKey(did, forceRefresh)
    }

    // it is important to always check the audience of the provided service JWT
    const payload = await verifyServiceJwt(jwt, 'did:example:server', getSigningKey)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
